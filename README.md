- 👋 Hi, I’m @alaingrdj
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of web development and data science. I love building user-facing applications that leverage data analysis to create a more insightful and personalized experience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and its powerful data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I'm also exploring web frameworks like Django or Flask to put my data skills to work on the web.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine web development with data science.  Maybe it's a data visualization dashboard, a machine learning powered recommendation system, or anything that uses data to enhance the user experience!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can code for hours, but I'm also an artist !
